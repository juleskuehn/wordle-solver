# wordle-solver

A decent wordle solver simply based on my intuition about what makes a "good" guess! I might update this with a reinforcement learning model later.

Read through the Jupyter notebook to learn more, or just try it out.

## Usage
* `pip install pandas numpy`
* `python wordle-solver.py`
